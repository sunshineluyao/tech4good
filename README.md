## Diversity and Inclusion Statement

At Tech4Good, we believe in the transformative power of technology to drive social good. Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is at the core of our mission to improve the accessibility of technology to broader audiences. We are dedicated to inspiring software development that benefits all, aiming to create solutions that are not only innovative but also inclusive and accessible.

We understand that the future of technology, especially in the realm of Web3, must be built on a foundation that values and prioritizes diverse perspectives. To truly harness the potential of Web3 and Distributed Computing Systems, we must foster an environment where individuals from all backgrounds feel welcomed, heard, and empowered to contribute. Our project is committed to breaking down barriers and making technology more accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or abilities.

Furthermore, we strive to make the world more interconnected, not just between systems but also among communities. By bridging gaps between different groups, we can create a more cohesive and collaborative ecosystem that leverages the strengths of diverse viewpoints for the common good.

We invite contributors, participants, and stakeholders from all walks of life to join us in this journey. Together, we can use the power of Web3 and distributed computing to create more inclusive, equitable, and interconnected solutions for our communities and the world at large.
