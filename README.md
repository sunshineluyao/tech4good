# Tech4Good Workshop Website

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the Tech4Good Workshop website. The Tech4Good Workshop is dedicated to exploring the intersection of technology and social good, with a focus on leveraging Web3 technologies to drive positive change.

The website is hosted on two Distributed Computing Systems to align with our commitment to the principles of Web3:

- **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP):** Accessible at [https://ibitc-4qaaa-aaaad-qf66a-cai.ic.fleek.co/](https://ibitc-4qaaa-aaaad-qf66a-cai.ic.fleek.co/)[^1]

[^2]: The website is hosted on a canister on the Internet Computer, identified by the canister ID `ibitc-4qaaa-aaaad-qf66a-cai`. The ICP canister ID `ibitc-4qaaa-aaaad-qf66a-cai` is a unique identifier for a canister smart contract on the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP) network. Canisters are computational units that can run smart contracts or store data, with each canister being assigned a unique ID for interaction.

- **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** Accessible at [https://tech4good.on.fleek.co](https://tech4good.on.fleek.co/)[^2]

[^2]: Our website is also accessible through IPFS hosting, providing a decentralized and resilient way to access content. IPFS, or the InterPlanetary File System, is a peer-to-peer protocol designed for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS hosting leverages this technology to serve websites and web applications in a decentralized manner, enhancing accessibility and resistance to censorship. By hosting content on IPFS, it is stored across multiple nodes globally, ensuring that it remains accessible even if some nodes go offline.



## Diversity and Inclusion Statement

At Tech4Good, we believe in the transformative power of technology to drive social good. Our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion is at the core of our mission to improve the accessibility of technology to broader audiences. We are dedicated to inspiring software development that benefits all, aiming to create solutions that are not only innovative but also inclusive and accessible.

We understand that the future of technology, especially in the realm of Web3, must be built on a foundation that values and prioritizes diverse perspectives. To truly harness the potential of Web3 and Distributed Computing Systems, we must foster an environment where individuals from all backgrounds feel welcomed, heard, and empowered to contribute. Our project is committed to breaking down barriers and making technology more accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or abilities.

Furthermore, we strive to make the world more interconnected, not just between systems but also among communities. By bridging gaps between different groups, we can create a more cohesive and collaborative ecosystem that leverages the strengths of diverse viewpoints for the common good.

We invite contributors, participants, and stakeholders from all walks of life to join us in this journey. Together, we can use the power of Web3 and distributed computing to create more inclusive, equitable, and interconnected solutions for our communities and the world at large.
