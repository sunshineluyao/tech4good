<span style="color:grey;">44th IEEE International Conference on Distributed Computing Systems (ICDCS 2024) Affiliated Workshop</span>

**Date:** July 16, 2023  
**Location:** Jersey City, New Jersey, USA  
**Venue:** co-located with ICDCS 2024  

---

We invite scholars, industry experts, and practitioners to contribute to the Tech4Good workshop. This event seeks to explore the nuanced interplay between computational science and economics amid the complexities of modern distributed systems, which are pivotal to the digital economy's growth and societal impact. With the digital economy's landscape dramatically reshaped, our collective focus is on addressing the emergent intricacies and human interaction challenges within these systems. We emphasize research that extends its reach beyond academia, informing industry practices and shaping policy advice. Our commitment is to foster interdisciplinary dialogue and harness a spectrum of research methodologies—be it theoretical analysis, empirical data studies, or hands-on experimental approaches. The spotlight is on pioneering technologies that not only drive economic growth but also navigate the delicate balance between scalability and privacy, security and efficiency, and the overarching demand for ethical frameworks in technological deployment. 

### Tracks for Submission:
- **Original Research Track:** For submissions detailing new research findings in distributed system modeling, algorithms, or implementation.
- **Research Perspective Track:** For contributions that review existing work, propose new research directions, or address interdisciplinary challenges.

Tech4Good caters to two distinct research tracks: the Original Research Track, spotlighting rigorous scientific inquiry into distributed systems modeling, algorithms, and implementation; and the Research Perspective Track, encouraging critical reviews and discussions on interdisciplinary challenges that shed light on future research directions. Both tracks are crafted to inspire innovation and push the frontiers of knowledge, accommodating diverse academic pursuits from theoretical advances to practical industry applications.

### Topics of focus
We invite submissions that rigorously explore technical challenges, economic integration, and ethical issues within distributed systems. Specific areas of interest include but are not limited to:
- distributed and federated machine learning
- blockchain
- generative AI
- IoT
- multi-agent systems
- edge computing and networking
- crowdsourcing
- distributed big-data analytics
- trust mechanisms in distributed environments.

> [^2]: Our website is also accessible through IPFS hosting, providing a decentralized and resilient way to access content. IPFS, or the InterPlanetary File System, is a peer-to-peer protocol designed for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. IPFS hosting leverages this technology to serve websites and web applications in a decentralized manner, enhancing accessibility and resistance to censorship. By hosting content on IPFS, it is stored across multiple nodes globally, ensuring that it remains accessible even if some nodes go offline.
